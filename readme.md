- no front-end framework was used to keep the project simple, altough some concepts from Twitter Bootstrap were used

- the layout is responsive, and small viewports are considered bellow 600px, which was the width of the original layout on Zeplin

- offscreen menu was based on https://www.sitepoint.com/pure-css-off-screen-navigation-menu/
